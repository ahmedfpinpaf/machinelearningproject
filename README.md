# ML_Internship_tasks
Remote Machine Learning internship at YoungDev Interns
My first ever machine learning internship

for the last expert task of the internship
This project demonstrates a complete Machine Learning deployment workflow:

✔ Train an ML model (Iris dataset)

✔ Serve the model using Flask

✔ Containerize with Docker

✔ Push to Docker Hub

✔ Deploy easily to the cloud (Render / Railway / AWS / Azure)

Features

Predicts Iris flower class using a pre-trained Logistic Regression model

REST API: /predict endpoint

Dockerized application for easy deployment

Lightweight & fast (Flask + joblib)
